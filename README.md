# Sentiment Analysis of Text using NLTK

This project performs sentiment analysis on text using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library in Python. It utilizes NLTK's tokenization, stemming, and sentiment analysis capabilities to analyze the sentiment of a given text.

## Features

- Preprocesses the text by tokenizing the sentences and applying stemming to reduce words to their base form.
- Performs sentiment analysis on each sentence using NLTK's SentimentIntensityAnalyzer.
- Determines the overall sentiment of the text based on the count of positive and negative sentences.
- Outputs the positive and negative sentences along with a sentiment analysis summary.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- NLTK library

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

[https://github.com/lorenzilarissa/sentiment-analysis.git](https://github.com/lorenzilarissa/nltk-sentiment-analysis/)

2. Install the required dependencies:

`pip install nltk`

3. Run the notebook:

- Open the `preprocessing.ipynb` notebook to preprocess the text and store the `sentences` variable.
- Open the `sentiment_analysis.ipynb` notebook to perform sentiment analysis on the text.

## Usage

1. Update the `paragraph` variable in `preprocessing.ipynb` with your desired text for sentiment analysis.
2. Run the `preprocessing.ipynb` notebook to preprocess the text and store the `sentences` variable.
3. Run the `sentiment_analysis.ipynb` notebook to perform sentiment analysis on the text and view the results.
